# An Introduction to Embedded Programming
## using the Arduino

Some friends have become interested in doing some embedded or bare-metal
programming. I've started writing some articles on the subject to help
them get started. This repository contains the code examples for this.

### Projects

#### 01\_getting\_started

[Article](https://www.kyleisom.net/projects/embedded-intro/getting-started/)

This getting started project goes through digital output via a blinking
LED (the microcontroller hello world) and serial output with the AVR
microcontroller.

#### 02\_interrupts\_and\_timers

[Article](https://www.kyleisom.net/projects/embedded-intro/interrupts-and-timers/)

The interrupts and timers project covers the first half of the article; it
demonstrates a simple timer interrupt to blink the LED.

#### 03\_strobe

[Article](https://www.kyleisom.net/projects/embedded-intro/interrupts-and-timers/)

The strobe project works with an IR proximity detector built with a 38 kHz
IR LED strobe and an IR receiver. It demonstrates more advanced interrupts,
including both timer interrupts and pin change interrupts.
