# An Introduction to Embedded Programming
## using the Arduino

Some friends have become interested in doing some embedded or bare-metal
programming. I've started writing some articles on the subject to help
them get started. This repository contains the code examples for this.

The [first post](https://www.kyleisom.net/projects/embedded-intro/getting-started/)
goes through the background needed to start writing embedded code.
